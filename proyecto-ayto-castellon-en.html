            <div class="project-content">
                <h3>The problem</h3>
                <p>The Castellón City Council website required a comprehensive update to meet current design and usability standards. As a public institution, it needed to offer numerous services to all municipality residents in an intuitive and accessible way. The challenge was to balance the information density typical of an institutional website with the simplicity needed for all types of users to complete their procedures comfortably.</p>
                
                <h3>The objectives</h3>
                <p>Create a simple, intuitive, and attractive design that allows all citizens, regardless of their technological skill level, to easily access municipal services. The main goal was to convey an accessible tone through a simple palette of 4 main colors and clear iconography that enhances navigation. The aim was to apply a Mobile-First approach that prioritizes the mobile experience, ensuring accessibility and facilitating administrative procedures.</p>
                
                <h3>The audience</h3>
                <p>Citizens of Castellón with very diverse profiles: from elderly people with limited technology skills to users with visual impairments, to citizens seeking to complete everyday procedures. The diversity of the target audience demands an inclusive design that meets accessibility standards and offers a consistent experience between web and mobile platforms.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Approach</h2>
            <div class="project-content">
                <h3>Research conducted</h3>
                <p>The process began with comprehensive benchmarking of 5 reference governmental websites: Cádiz City Council (Spain), GSA - General Services Administration (United States), Norwich City Council (United Kingdom), Norway Gateway to Digital Public Services (Norway), and Dubai Municipality (United Arab Emirates). Analysis criteria included information structure, mobile-first design, visual appeal, and accessibility level. This research identified effective patterns such as cascade menus, use of color to delineate functions, intuitive iconography, and attractive headers with institutional elements.</p>

                <h3>Design decisions</h3>
                <p>The color palette was simplified to 4 main colors, each assigned to a section of the website to facilitate navigation. Cascade menus were incorporated to distribute information effectively with intuitive functionality. Icons are large and clearly represent the action they perform, improving content cohesion. A header was designed with the city council's coat of arms and name alongside city photography, clearly communicating the institutional purpose. Quick links were implemented through icon buttons, a notice banner with delay, a configurable cookie modal, and 4 and 12-column grids with 20px spacing. Typography styles were reduced to 4: 2 for headers and 2 for body text and icons.</p>

                <h3>Technical challenges</h3>
                <p>The biggest challenge was finding the balance between modern aesthetics and accessibility for a very diverse audience. Adapting the design so that both versions (mobile and desktop) reflect a mobile-first approach required multiple iterations. Selecting a valid color palette to delineate sections while maintaining a contemporary style demanded several tests to achieve a satisfactory result. Ensuring that the iconography is accurate and understandable for the majority of the audience while maintaining cohesion with the overall style required special attention. Finally, prioritizing user experience in all design decisions when working with public institutions posed a challenge of managing institutional requirements vs. citizen needs.</p>
